# Prescription  
- 45 Gy to 5040 Gy to at risk areas
- IMRT / VMAT 


# Volumes 

#####GTV = Tumor bed and nodal volumes contructed with preoperative imaging and surgical clip placement. 

#### Proximal Lesion 
  - Include splenic hilum and left medial diaphragm in the target volume, but inf extent does not need to go to L3
  - May just go to L1-2 coverage of the superior mesenteric artery or P-A nodes

#### Distal Lesion 
  - Include 1st portion of the duodenal C-loop but not the splenic hilum
  - For proximal and distal lesions and -nodes with adequate dissection, the remnant of the stomach does not need to be covered. For body lesions, however, the gastric remnant needs to be covered in all cases.

#### If Node Positive
- **Include** 
	- Stomach, Tumor bed
	- Anastomosis 
	- Surgical Clips 
	- Nodal drainage 
- **Nodal Bed Optional if**
	  - Node negative 
	  - 15 or more nodes resected 
	  - Margins 5cm or greater surgically 

## CTV Lymph Nodes 

- **GE junction:** mediastinal, periesophageal, celiac, perigastric
- **Proximal stomach:** perigastric, periesophageal, celiac, pancreaticoduodenal, porta hepa
- **Body**: perigastric, splenic, celiac, peripancreatic, porta hepatis
- **Distal stomach**: perigastric, periduodenal, peripancreatic, porta hepatis, celiac

# Organs at Risk 
- Remnant of stomach: 45 Gy
- Kidney: V18 <30%
- Liver: V30 <50%-70%
- Heart: If RT alone V40 <50%, V40 <40%
- Spinal cord: â‰¤45 Gy
